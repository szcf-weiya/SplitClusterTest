Description: FDR Control via Data Splitting for Testing-after-Clustering
    Particularly, in single-cell community, testing-after-clustering aims to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes across
    different cell types (or along pseudotime). However, the naive testing-after-clustering will inflate the false positives, which 
    is also referred as the double-dipping issue.
